# ToDo

fix up this file and the data/expand/README.md

## Functionality

- run tests and fix documentation examples !!
- use testing framework to speed up tests (so we don't have to load everything every time from Contractions::default())
- Remove She's, He's, It's
- Use parts of speech tagging to figure out if the next word after (She's/...) is a verb, this way we can resolve it
- Use parts-of-speech tagging or named-entity-recognition to figure out if the 's is a possessive or a 'is'
