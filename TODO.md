# ToDo

fix up this file and the data/expand/README.md

## Functionality

- Add example in README.md
- add() and remove() to change dataset
- Remove She's, He's, It's
- use and test partials
- finish documentation
- upload to crates.io
- generate documentation (and upload it to docs.rs)
- Use parts of speech tagging to figure out if the next word after (She's/...) is a verb, this way we can resolve it
- Use parts-of-speech tagging or named-entity-recognition to figure out if the 's is a possessive or a 'is'
