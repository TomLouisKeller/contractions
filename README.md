# Problem cases:


- Ain't
    "The word 'ain't' is a contraction for am not, is not, are not, has not, and have not in the common English language vernacular. In some dialects ain't is also used as a contraction of do not, does not, and did not." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ain't
    We therefore do not include ain't.
- Some contractions with "'s" can be is or a possesive
  - "everyone's" can be "everyone's country" or "everyone is"
  - "somebody's"
- He's -> can be he is or he has. but we replace it with He is.
